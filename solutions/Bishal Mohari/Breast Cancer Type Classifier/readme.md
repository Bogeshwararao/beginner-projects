# Breast Cancer Type Classifier [ Chunin Projects ]
We are given a [dataset on Breast Cancer](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) with various features that determine whether a cancer(tumor) is  Benign and Malignant.
Our goal is to make a Machine Learning Model to predict the features that are most significant for determining the type of cancer.

## Motivation
Inorder to check my understanding of the ML-classification models and determining an optimum model from among them for this dataset. 

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with</b>
- [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org)
- [Python](https://electron.atom.io)

## Features of the dataset
We determine the most optimum features among the following features --
Attribute Information:

1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
3-32)
Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
resulting in 30 features. 

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
